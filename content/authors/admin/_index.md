I am a student researcher and lab manager for the Bilingualism, Mind, and Brain lab at UC Irvine.
My research interests are focused on the long-term effects of being extracted from a linguistic environment during early childhood. I want to consider the consequences not of being denied access to language input, but of switching the nature of that input from an initial language exposure, what would ordinarily be considered the native language, to a context in which the native language is no longer available.
